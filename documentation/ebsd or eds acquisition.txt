EBSD/EDS acquisition in DM is defined in the IPrep:EBSD tags. The EBSD/EDS step follows the imaging step. At this moment, there is only 1 ROI (as limitation by OI plugin). 
The settings will generally be what it will be left at after the last ROI has been imaged in the imaging step (ie magnification). it does allow you go specify another semcoord. 

Parameters: 

acquire_n_slice: acquire data every n slices

data_prefix: the prefix of the acquisition name in Aztec

semcoord: the semcoord used for acquisition

sitename: the sitename defined in Aztec for acquisition

type: 
	2: EDS 
	1: SEM (don't know why you would acquire SEM images in Aztec, but you can)
	4: EBSD (can also have EDS enabled, but that is part of EBSD workflow in Aztec)



NB: for unknown reasons, when using EBSD, you need to let DM generate sitename for EBSD. if you don't, Aztec will use default parameters for acquisition and generate a new sitename even if the same name already exists. The Manchester system does not seem to have this issue.
