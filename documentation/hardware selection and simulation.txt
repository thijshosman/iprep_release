different hardware instances/implementations can be selected for each device, based on tags in IPrep:simulation. the workflow is sending commands without knowing what the SEM is, but the SEM implementation takes care of these details. This means it is easy to simulate things. 

in general, 1 means simulation (ie hardware not present so just have a simulation class that acts like hardware), 2 means implemented as in demo unit 1, 3 means as in Manchester. all this is defined in IPrep_hardwareFactory.s

summary of differences: 

PECS
rev1 (manchester): 
-gate valve uses av2/av3 without specific board
-no coating
rev2 (alpha 2/demo 1):
-coating
-uses gv board

SEM
Nova (manchester):
-blanking disabled since it causes dynamic focus to turn off
-focus not explicitly reset in nominal_imaging
-no magbugfix
Quanta (alpha 2/demo 1):
-focus updated and stored and reset back when going to nominal_imaging
-a workaround for mag problems is added

Gripper
rev1 (manchester):
-no additional closing steps after gripper has closed/sensor has triggered
rev2 (alpha 2/demo 1):
-close a few more steps after sensor has triggered

Transfer/Parker
These are 2 different controllers. IPA is an upgraded version of ARIES with the same interface but a lot of changes. the interface to the workflow is the same. major ones are: 
ARIES (manchester):
-original implementation Oct 2015, few changes since. includes torque limits
IPA (alpha 2/demo 1):
-direction of motion added
-method of circumventing communication issues in which IPA does not always send back prompt
-torque limit in different way: this one is set in volts and experimentally verified.
