what follows are common parameters defined for a ROI. some of these are self evident, but a basic understanding is needed to know how the workflow traverses the ROI object and sets things. 
ROIs are all in IPrep:ROIs


af_before: 
	1: run af routine before imaging
	0: run af routine after imaging
	NB: ignored if af is not enabled

af_mode: 
	0: leave focus alone
	1: autofocus every nth slice (see af_n_slice for n value)
	2: use the focus defined in this ROI

af_n_slice: when autofocus is enabled (af_mode == 1), this value determines how many slices af is used

focus: focus value, only used if af_mode == 2

enabled: 
	0: the workflow will skip this ROI
	1: the workflow will visit this ROI, order set by order tag

imageOn: 
	1: imaging for this ROI enabled (default)
	0: no imaging. can be used for ROI that just needs focusing

order: workflow will visit ROIs in ascending order (so 1, 2, 3, .., 100)

image_n_slice: image every n slices

mag: magnification value for this ROI

name: name of the ROI

coordName: name of the coord used by ROI. this is not the same as the ROI name, and the reason is that sometimes you want to reuse a coord for multiple ROIs (at different mags etc)

digiscan_param: digiscan parameters used for this ROI. only exception is StoredImaging ROI; for this ROI it uses the global capture settings
