default PID for IPA+motor:
P=0.0024414
I=0
D=0.000010
Torque limit <1

homing command (at reasonable speed in pos direction):
P00>BIT799=0
P00>BIT798=0
P00>JOG ACC X100.000000
P00>JOG DEC X100.000000
P00>JOG JRK X0.0
P00>JOG VEL X25.000000
P00>JOG HOME X+1

make sure stp and jrk are not too low; in that case, they will limit the speed
doing steps sets acc and dec really high
values used for moving in non-jog mode:
vel 400
acc 1000
dec 1000
jrk 200
stp 1000

all the usual stuff is commented in initializing transfer is commented out

configuration status: 

DRCONFIG: shows all errors and warnings
C command are configuration parameters, S command are status parameters
can be issued in prog0
so ?S20 shows temperature of drive, ?C6 shows max drive temperature configuration


parameters: 
torque: 
not quite sure where the torque limit lives. it can be set by the configuration wizard and the program follows that value, but don't know what the parameters is or the command to set it. the status panel uses a "% of peek" value which is the signal output of the servo loop (P12319), but that is not it. ?C14 is also not it since it does not change. TLM is the command that the guide describes as setting the limit, ?P12328 for plus and ?P12329 for minus, which are now set to +0.4 (and -0.4). verified experimentally that 0.1 is too low. command: TLM AXIS0 0.3
0.1: too low, fails on insertion
0.4: works
0.3: works
0.2: works
0.1: too low again, fails on insertion
0.15: works
0.125: works, leaving it at that, measured to be about 11 lbs on force gauge

setting limit to 0.125 volts for now. 
we can dynamically adjust this to use lower values during actual transfer and this value during dovetail insertion

0.125 is not enough for dropoff in vacuum, so we are increasing it
0.135: works in vacuum (with planar holder)
0.135 failed in vacuum after pumping overnight. trying again with 0.150
0.150: succesful 3 times in vacuum, then failed
0.160: trying in vacuum. still failed in 9th attempt 
keeping it at 0.160 after changing how far the gripper arms close
after 1 error during attempt 30, increasing to 0.170
0.170: going with this. 200 succesfull transfers, but still dependent on angle
after swapping to different mount and back to original mount, we get problems. increasing to 0.190
0.190: going well so far, testing in vacuum
0.200: desperate attempt to keep it from tripping when inserting into dovetail
0.200: extensive rebuilt of gripper and realignment, now operates smootly. 
0.200: due to bing bug, stage was raised during transfer and hit the gripper when it was moving forward. didn't seem to cause damage, but did not operate smoothly until steppermotor current was changed from 20 to 25% of max, so now we need to lower limit 
0.170: succesful transfer in air, now in vacuum.
