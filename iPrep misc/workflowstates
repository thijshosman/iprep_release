workflowstates are numbers and this file explain what those numbers represent
0: undefined
1: init in pecs, sample in PECS, milling
2: init in SEM, sample in SEM, imaging



options in each state: 
options with () are to be implemented methods


0:
manually enter state system is in()

1: 
move sample to SEM()

use PECS camera in DM
set up milling parameters
play with PECS stage, align, rotate, turn milling on
move sample in and out with transfer device
take optical image and save in [1]

2: 
set up directory root for experiment and create subdir for optical images [1] and SEM survey images [2]
move stage around, move beam around
query milling parameters()
set imaging position stage will return to()
move back to PECS()
start run()
take alignment images()
crosscorelate alignment images()
take SEM image and save in [2]
go to imaging position stored()
