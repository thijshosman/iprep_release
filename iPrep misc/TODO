Sal:
-lock out Quanta UI from DM when needed (if possible)
-lock out PECS UI from DM when needed
-do not call setup_imaging anymore
-buttons to:
	-set mag for imaging
	-store StoredImaging
	-

Thijs:
-interface for SEM coordinates from tags


hardware problems:
-parker: requesting position sometimes causes error, solution to try is to catch this and add second layer of protection
-dock: did not register it was up once
