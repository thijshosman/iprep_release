A (before packing up): 
-framework for error handling
-save SEMcoords object into tags
-update sem_iprep to add consistency check for sem state changes
-puncture classes with 3 checks. check for tags to prevent interface problems in classes:
	-transfer checks if gv was last in open state before moving
	-transfer checks if sem stage is in pickup_dropoff or clear
	-gv checks if parker is < 200 before closing
-add gate valve state to tag
-figure out how real com port can be used for allmotion instead of usb
-add kill all motion check to transfer class
-proper start routine
-update functions in Sal's UI module to include error handling
-make sure workflow can start from PECS as well (after DM restart)

-clean up main to put stuff back in classes below
	-remove kv/wd stuff from sem class
	-handle imaging from main, remove from state machine and workflow
	-handle pecs camera back in pecs class
