A: 
-framework for error handling
	v-string set for deadflag with reason deadflag was set - what device did set errorcode?
	-table of errorcodes
	-integrate setting reason for error and last device into workflow
	-add a throw method to each hardware class that sets the "last device" and "last errorcode" tag. those can be read back out by deadflagobject
v-save SEMcoords object into tags->use examples John
	v-new SEMcoordManager class that is instantiated by SEM_iprep that has methods for:
	v-replace semcoord attributes of SEM_iprep class so that SEM_iprep methods that need coordinates get them directly from the tags through the semcoordmanager
v-puncture classes with checks as defined in iprep_general
	v-make sure safety is at the lowest level
	v-create interface for iprep_general to allow checks names to be in device classes through mediator
	-checks:
		v-SEM: SEM checks that parker is < 400 before moving except pickup/dropoff
		v-PECS: only close GV when parker < 150
		v-PECS: only move stage up when parker < 20
		v-Parker: only move > 150 when GV is open
		v-Parker: only move > 400 when SEM in pickup/dropoff or clear
		v-Parker: check that PECS stage is lowered when moving
		-do not go in negative direction with gripper closed if it is in the pecs
v-ABC for hw to simulate iprep after it ships. make choice in linearWorkflow. no base
	v-dock-simulator and dock
		-planardock and ebsddock differentiation solution
	-sem and sem-simulator 
	v-pecs and pecs-simulator
	v-gripper and gripper-simulator
	v-transfer and transfer-simulator
-test the simulators with well defined tests in separate files
	v-gripper
	v-dock
	v-pecs
	v-transfer
	-sem 
v-check for hw bridge fault (or any fault) in transfer class
(sal)-proper start routine that does checks of hardware and states in workflow
	-make sure workflow can start/resume from PECS as well (ie after DM restart)
		-it detects the current state 
(sal)-update functions in Sal's UI module to include error handling through return values and agree on what happens in that case
-integrate EBSD camera class into workflow
-make workflow compatible with choosing planar vs EBSD
	-use settings button
-init functions checks consistency between expected state tags and actual state as read from sensors. if there is a discrepancy, notify user and do not allow process to start. allow manual recovery/setup of correct state. this is needed when DM starts to make sure everything is right
	-detect power failure
		-check UPS for power failure
	-hardware:
		v-PECS Gate valve (open/closed) against sensor inputs
		v-PECS stage (lowered/raised) against WL sensor state
		v-SEM add consistency check for sem state changes that checks current state against coordinates saved in tag
		v-transfer last saved position vs aries controller
	v-state inference:
		v-workflowstate and last finished step to figure out where to recover
-SEM state check once every cycle
	-decide what to check in SEM - emission current? 
v-dock change names to clamp and unclamp
v-workflow checks that sample is present in dock - after dropoff - uncommented for now in simulator
v-workflow checks that sample is no longer present in dock - after pickup - uncommented for now in simulator
-absolute coordinates for SEM stage
v-reseating function that sets carrier into dovetail but never leaves PECS
-transfer position solution that differentiates between ebsd and planar
-lock out SEM stage rotation/tilt in FEI software


B:
-implement consistent and well thought out user dialog in combination of results/debug/logfile/UI menus
	-add timestamp to print functions
-UI elements to show status
-clean up main to put stuff back in classes below
	-remove kv/wd stuff from sem class
	-handle imaging from main, remove from state machine and workflow
	-handle pecs camera back in pecs class
-multi ROI
-enable 3Dvolume again
-transfer position tags become deltas, and deltas allow change. hardcode real positions, do not allow delta's more than a certain value.
-UPS check once every cycle
	-make late binding method with executescriptstring method
-transfer positions:
	-use deltas. store real position in code, have tag for deltas

device specific:
Tranfer:
-detect if system has been homed since last powerup

sal:
-no more end slice

existing:
IPrep_abortrun(): called by script, aborts current loop
IPrep_startrun(): executed when start button is pressed
IPrep_pauserun(): executed when pause button is pressed
IPrep_stoprun(): executed when stop button is pressed

After install:
Features
-add FWD decoupling after EBSD run (since OI might change it)
v-lock out pecs UI during reseating
-lock out SEM ui (rotation/tilt)
-make sure that an unsafe condition turns off beam (though mediator)
-clear and pickup_dropoff are 5 mm from eachother. this may be too much and lead to interference of planar fork with sample. make 3 mm instaed. test with ali
-store vector of where scribe mark should be and compare to old value. adjust transfer positions with this vector
	-have user move ROI into position and determine center
	-determine vector in um from center of image to center of ROI
	-move scribe mark with user supplied vector and have user confirm before storing position/correction in tags
-dock swap/install:
	-store rotation value in tag
	-make sure SEM is homed/will home after swap to ensure no inconsistency problems when changing docks
	-warn the user to use correct carrier
-IPrep_check: check rotation value against stored value on dock install
-add pogo pin check to workflow. use dialog with timeout to ensure user has option to override
	-?how do we have a ui okcanceldialog with tiemout?
-add ebsd step to workflow (first manual)
-make different functions for transfering in workflow and as ui elements to ensure that checks are run accordingly
-have progresswindow updated by mediator
	-we can use iprep_getstatus(), which gets called periodically, as the observer for updating this. 
v-use number of slices as stop condition of workflow loop
v-re-enable check for average pixel value after acquisition
-re-enable 3D volume history stack
-show current step in workflow (in progresswindow?)
-turn protected flag on or off in ui
-multi ROI
	-some ui for this
	-autofocus as option
	-focus shift as option

Bugs:
v-workflow goes to nominal imaging, not stored imaging
v-saving imaging conditions before workflow blanks beam
