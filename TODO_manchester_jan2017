* [x] make printing all ROIs more verbose by adding sem positions
* [x] make sure init of single/multi ROI mode is clear in UI
* [x] when using StoredImaging ROI as one of the multi ROI rois, make sure 3Dvol is initialized correctly

* [] check naming of storedimaging ROI file names

* [] check max slice number check

* [] make option to make beam blank at end of image acquisition. this is because blanking beam from dm disables dynamic focus

* [] add option to go to backoff_sem position in service menu

* [] check moving from clear directly to storedimaging

* [] ebsd will usually use same mag as storedImaging. add option for different mag, but use normal mag in default case

* [] EBSD acquisition needs an FSD/SE image to accompany it for that particular slice. Plugin probably allows this since FEI uses it. when using type 1 imaging it generates a separate SE/FSD image that gets added as an additional part of the next EBSD acquisitions. 

* [] find a way to inform user of imaging mode (multi/single)

* [x] dynamic focus turnoff
* [] electron images followed by ebsd/eds in aztec
* [] b/c
